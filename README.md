Description: 
  The game is a simulation of a pokemon battle, a turn based role playing game. The player will choose a pokemon and face off against a random enemy pokemon. Every turn, the player can choose one of 4 moves for the pokemon to use to either attack the opponent, debuff the opponent, or recover health. Some moves may also increase the user’s stats, or decrease the enemy’s stats. The battle continues until one pokemon faints i.e. their health is reduced to 0.

This small game project is a great practise for us to improve our coding skills. Thanks everyone in my team for contributing!

Thank you for playing our game!
